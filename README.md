# machine-learning

 here I will add some interesting machine learning projects soon!

# 1) A neural network from scratch:
        - build a neural network with just the numpy package
        - uses mini batch-gradient descent with regularisation and momentum, flexible geometry and various
          activation functions     
        - fully vectorised and less than twice as slow as the same Keras model (see benchmark in notebook)
        - used for MNIST written digits classification (98.3% accuracy)
