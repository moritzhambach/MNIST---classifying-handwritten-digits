# machine-learning
#
# here I will add some interesting machine learning projects soon!
#
# 1) building a neural network from scratch:
#        - no Keras/tensorflow, just the numpy package
#        - simple neural network with regularisation, flexible geometry and various activation functions    
#        - uses mini batch-gradient descent 
#        - fully vectorised and only twice as slow as the same Keras model (see benchmark in notebook)
#        - used for MNIST written digits classification (96.6% accuracy)
